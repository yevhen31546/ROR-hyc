Dokku and Github
It's actually really easy.

Go from Local straight to Production

Check Your Git is a local Git but current production
make sure when you make ssh key that you include 'admin' in the name.

git status
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean

git remote -v
origin	https://github.com/vinylmatt/hycruby.git (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/vinylmatt/hycruby.git (push)
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh root@172.105.81.48 dokku ssh-keys:add adminmattu
root@172.105.81.48's password: 
HASH HASH HERE
git remote add production4 dokku@172.105.81.48:hyc-prod
git push production4 master

Log onto the server as root to rake the DB
ssh root@172.105.81.48


dokku run hyc-prod rake db:migrate:up VERSION=20190910041206

The version number comes from here:
https://github.com/vinylmatt/hycruby/tree/master/db/migrate

Once this is all done we 
dokku ps:rebuild hyc-prod
dokku config:set hyc-prod PAYMENT_URL=https://https://hyc-payment-dev.vinyl-matt.com/

and that is that. There are warnings. There is old crap.
See the video in this folder about how to setup the links for backend and front end.
